## [Unreleased]

### 🖱️ Official Worlds & portal UX polish
Follow-up polish to the hosted-worlds flow (portal + in-game *Official Worlds* menu).
- **Loading spinners** everywhere an action runs in the background — waking/playing, creating, stopping, deleting and uploading a save. The web portal now also gives stopping and deleting a progress state (button disabled + "Stopping…/Deleting…" → "stopped/deleted"); before, those looked like nothing happened until the list refreshed.
- **Play → clearer name handling in the game client**: if the chosen player name is reserved or not allowed, an in-place prompt lets you pick another name and retries the join, instead of a dead-end error you could only fix from the main menu.
- **"Play" (portal)** reads a prefilled, remembered player-name field instead of a pop-up prompt; the browser-play button is the clear primary action with the native host/port/token in an expander.
- **Official Worlds window** widened and laid out as a clean grid: the five action buttons share one uniform row, the per-world Play/Manage buttons line up with the columns above them, and the world **status** ("starting…", "running") gets its own wide column so it never hides behind the buttons.
- **One window for both world lists (game client)**: public worlds no longer open a second window. The *Official Worlds* screen now shows your own worlds and the public ones in a single scrollable view, split into clearly labelled **"My worlds"** and **"Public worlds"** sections (own worlds are filtered out of the public list).

## [0.7.3] — 2026-07-07

Find and join worlds other players are running, plus a round of interface fixes. (#287)

### 🌍 Public world browser
Hosted worlds used to be invite-only — there was no way to discover a world someone else made; you needed a link or token from its owner. Now there's an opt-in public list.
- Owners can list a world publicly with a per-world toggle — in the portal **and** in the game's **Official Worlds** menu — but **only once the world has a join password**, so a listed world is never wide open. Worlds stay private by default, and removing the password automatically un-lists the world.
- A new **"Public worlds"** section (portal card + in-game browse dialog) shows everyone's listed worlds; joining still asks for the owner-shared password, so discovery never means free entry.

### 🖥️ Interface fixes
- **Credits screen** — the contributor text now scrolls inside its panel (with a scrollbar) instead of spilling out the bottom and being covered by the Back button.
- **"Create world" (portal)** — the button now shows a "Creating…" → "Created 🚀" state and refreshes the list itself, so it no longer looks like nothing happened until you reload the page.
- **"Play" (portal)** — reads a prefilled, remembered player-name field instead of a pop-up prompt; clearer "waking…/ready" messages, with the browser-play button as the obvious primary action and the native host/port/token tucked into an expander.
- **Official Worlds** — the "View rules" button no longer crowds the panel's edge.

## [0.7.2] — 2026-07-06

Play the whole hosted-worlds flow without ever opening a browser, grow your own food, pen in your creatures, get treasure hints from villagers, and start new games somewhere friendlier — plus a round of UI polish.

### 🖥️ Play without a browser — full client-portal parity
Everything you could previously only do on the web portal now works inside the game's **Official Worlds** menu; for desktop players the website is optional. (#271, closes #268–#270, #272)
- **Sign up in-game** with the community rules shown and accepted right there. A new anonymous `GET /api/terms` single-sources the rules text with the `/rules` page (via a new `CommunityRules` class) so they can never drift, and an outdated-terms login opens a **re-accept flow**.
- **Create a world** (name + optional join password with a repeat check) and a **per-world manage dialog**: set/remove the join password, stop the world, or delete it behind a type-the-name confirmation.
- **Save backup round-trip without a browser** — download to / upload from `portal_saves/<worldId>-world.db` with an "Open folder" button (world must be stopped; the 50 MB cap surfaces server-side).
- **Feedback & ideas** form and **GDPR account deletion** (type-the-name confirm; erases the account, its worlds and saves) are both reachable in-game.
- **WebGL round-trip** — the browser client gains a visible "My Worlds / Account" button linking back to the worlds portal on the same origin (#272). It still never selects servers itself, so no portal features are duplicated in WebGL.
- **UI polish** — modal dialogs are now fully opaque everywhere (forms no longer shine through), the settings list scrolls, overlay notices wrap instead of clipping, the Play/Manage row buttons are wide enough for their labels, signup shows a proper "Password (at least 8 characters)" label, and the rules screen shows a friendly offline message + retry instead of silently dropping "accept" when the terms can't be reached.

### 🌱 Algae tank — grow food from water at a base
- New **algae tank** station block, the game's first food-producing machine (detoxifier station-recipe pattern, base-only). (#265, closes #261)
- Crafted at the workshop (2 metal panel + 3 glass, no blueprint); turns **1 water → 2 algae rations** (+30 hunger). A new hand recipe (2 ice → 1 water) feeds it.
- Dedicated bubbling craft cue, new block tile + ration icon, and full bilingual Codex coverage (survival-guide article + auto chapters).

### 🐾 Energy fence & gate — pen in creatures, companions and enemies
Wild creatures, companions and planet enemies never consult the voxel world for collision, so ordinary walls can't hold them. Two new blocks change that. (#266, closes #263)
- **`energy_fence`** — a solid emissive pylon that blocks players, NPCs *and* all fauna (workshop: 2 metal panel + 2 cable → 4).
- **`energy_gate`** — a non-solid membrane players and NPCs walk through but fauna bounce off; a door with no open/close state (workshop: 2 metal panel + 1 energy cell + 1 circuit board → 1).
- A new fauna fence sweep wires this into creature, companion and enemy movement — so a pen holds your own animals and the fence doubles as base defense. Flying creatures glide over normal-height fences (documented).
- New atlas tiles for both blocks plus an `energy_fence_hum` loop; DE+EN locales, taming wiki article and manual sections.

### 🗺️ NPC treasure hints
Settlement NPCs can now point you toward the crashed wreck and hidden caches. (#267, closes #262)
- On greeting there's a **35% chance to emit a hint** instead of the flavour line: the wreck (while unclaimed) for everyone; the nearest unlooted chest only once your relationship reaches "known".
- The reveal is **world-global and co-op friendly** — the POI is added to the map and broadcast to all joined players, and persisted in world metadata (no codec change).
- The spoken line is deterministic and localized DE+EN: an 8-way compass direction + distance, torus-wrap aware. Claimed wrecks and looted chests drop out automatically and are never re-hinted.

### 🪨 Friendlier start planet
- New games now start on a **hospitable planet** (varied) instead of toxic, plantless rocky; carbon ore was added to varied so the medpack/energy-cell chain still works. Only new worlds are affected — existing saves keep their persisted start type. (#264, closes #260)
- World generation is hardened: an unknown or unmatched start type no longer crashes world load (it falls back to the first breathable planet with flora).
- Fixed a latent bug this surfaced: breathable-surface health regen ran before the same-tick death check, so a 0-HP player was nudged to 0.2 HP and **never respawned**. No regen at 0 HP now.

### 🌐 Portal polish & security
- **Discoverable DE/EN language switcher** — a header "DE | EN" pill (the old switcher was invisible grey footer links), plus `Accept-Language` detection on first visit. Auto-detection sets no cookie; only an explicit choice persists. (#259)
- Resolved both open CodeQL alerts: the `bbs_lang` cookie now sets `Secure` + `HttpOnly`, and the `/admin/announce` handler logs the world id through the safe helper. (#259)

### 📚 Docs
- README now links to the game's website. (#264)

## [0.7.1] — 2026-07-06

This release is all about **playing together safely**: world creators can password-protect their worlds, server restarts announce themselves with an in-game countdown, reporting and feedback are easier to find (especially for kids), the portal got a kid-friendly rework, and the Play button finally launches the game right in your browser.

### 🔒 World join passwords
World creators can lock a hosted world with a password — perfect for "just my friends" worlds. (#255)
- Set, change or remove the password any time in the portal; new worlds can get one at creation (with a confirm field so no typos lock you out).
- Joining asks for the password — in the portal and in the game client (masked input). The world owner never needs one.
- Guess-proof: 10 wrong tries in 15 minutes puts a cooldown on that world, and sleeping worlds aren't even woken for wrong guesses.

### 🔧 Maintenance announcements
Server restarts no longer come out of nowhere. (#255)
- In-game countdown banner when a maintenance restart is scheduled, plus an acknowledgeable dialog and a proper "server is restarting" screen instead of a generic disconnect.
- New commands `//restart <minutes>` and `//cancelrestart` for world admins, a token-gated `/announce` endpoint, and an **Announce card in `/admin`** with a per-world graceful-restart button.
- Worlds finish the countdown, save, and stop cleanly — no more surprise kicks.

### 🧒 Kid-friendly portal & feedback
The web portal now reads like the family project it is. (#258)
- New **"Feedback & ideas" card** on the worlds page — kids and parents can send wishes directly, without filing a "report" against anyone; feedback lands in its own `/admin` queue, separate from player reports.
- Parental notice on the landing page, and "ask your parents first" is now the first community rule.
- Kid UX pass: create-account card comes first, the name field speaks plain words, a "write your password down!" warning replaces jargon, and the join prompt remembers your player name.
- Reporting is discoverable: rules and portal now point at the in-game Report button and `/report` command first.

### 🛡️ Easier reporting in-game
- New **`/report <name>` chat command** on official worlds — it attaches the last 10 chat lines as evidence. (#248)
- Every report now records **which world it happened in** — from the button, the command and the portal form. (#248)
- `/help` now leads with the commands for everyone (`/report`, `/bump`), and official worlds show a one-time chat tip pointing at both report paths (DE+EN). (#258)

### 🌐 Play in the browser, for real
- The portal **Play button now launches the game directly in your browser** — signed in, world picked, one click, playing — by deep-linking the WebGL client with a short-lived join token. (#256)
- Fixed the Play button doing nothing for returning players (a permission wipe ate the grant). (#256)
- The whole portal is now fully bilingual (DE/EN, `?lang=en` or the toggle) and finally shows the game logo and a favicon. (#256)

### 🛠️ Fixes & polish
- **Stopping a server during initial world generation now works** — previously the stop was ignored and the container was force-killed (exit 137); the generation grace period is also longer now. (#247)
- Admin server-health card shows the real host core count, so the load bar means what it says.
- Hardened the admin stop endpoint against log forging (CodeQL): world ids are sanitized before logging.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-05

A big visual glow-up with the **organic look overhaul**, plus **gamepad and touch controls**, hosted **Official Worlds** with a web portal, a fleshed-out in-game **Codex**, and a **browser client** that's actually playable end-to-end.

### 🎨 Organic look overhaul
A full presentation pass — all client-side, no save/world migration needed. (#192)
- Softer voxel surfaces (per-vertex + cavity AO, beveled convex edges). (#186)
- GPU-instanced grass tufts and pebbles on open ground. (#187)
- 3D mesh flora — leaning 3-plane plant rosettes; cacti, crystals and mushrooms are real shapes. (#188)
- Finer building shapes: panel, post, beam, low ramp, quarter cube. (#189)
- Fully orientable shapes (all 24 orientations, auto-orient, rebindable rotate key). (#190)
- Sparse raised plating on exposed ship hull faces. (#191)

### 🎮 Gamepad & touch controls (experimental)
The whole input epic (#193) shipped — inert on desktop keyboard+mouse.
- Gamepad/controller support behind a new input-abstraction layer (flight, EVA, menus, building). (#199)
- Pad rebinding in Settings with device-aware button glyphs. (#206)
- On-screen touch controls with localized labels (DE+EN). (#204, #206)
- Text entry on touch in the browser; menus navigable by pad focus-nav. (#206)
- ⚠️ On-device feel still being playtested (#201–#203).

### 🌍 Hosted Official Worlds (beta)
Player-created worlds hosted by us, joinable in one click — no port forwarding, no server setup. (#227)
- "Official Worlds" in the main menu; sleeping worlds wake on demand and idle worlds shut down cleanly.
- Web portal with privacy-minimal sign-up (name + password, no email), world create/manage, and save upload/download.
- Kid-friendly bilingual community rules + a beta notice; **DSGVO account self-deletion**. (#233)
- One-tap in-game **Report** button + portal report form; operators can review and ban, enforced at join.
- Optional AI backend runs containerized in the fleet (internal-only, OpenAI-compatible) and feeds NPC chatter. (#234)
- Basic-Auth `/admin` panel: live fleet overview, report queue, ban/unban, server-health card; public aggregate-only `/api/stats`. (#234, #246)
- Per-world memory/CPU/pids fences + a global cap on awake worlds. (#234)
- Fixed a stale container blocking every re-wake, found in the first real end-to-end test. (#235)
- Developer names protected against impersonation + a blocked-name filter. (#230)
- Worlds untouched for months are archived, not deleted, and restored transparently on join. (#230)
- Rate limits on signups, logins, save uploads and reports + Prometheus metrics. (#230)
- Self-hosting unchanged — everything inert by default. Fleet deploys from the repo via an approval-gated SSH workflow. (#229, #231)

### 🐛 Self-owned bug-report inbox
- New **ReportHost** service: a small Docker container that receives F1 feedback and crash reports (unchanged wire contract), stores them in SQLite with screenshots, and offers a filterable triage UI. (#227)
- One-click JSON bulk export honoring the current filters. (#234)

### 📖 Codex
- Every block, item and all 19 worlds now have bilingual (EN/DE) descriptions, plus 14 new guide articles. (#184)
- Codex is fully navigable again: working chapter links, list descriptions, correct scan names. (#178)

### 🌐 Browser client
The experimental WebGL path is now genuinely playable.
- Fixed falling through terrain on landing — chunks and colliders now build synchronously on WebGL. (#205, #207)
- One-click `/play` flow polished (required name, deep-linking, dark loading template, reliable touch). (#217–#222)
- WebGL builds no longer drag in the desktop updater (Velopack); dedicated WebGL attach workflow. (#151)

### 🛠️ Fixes & polish
- You can walk out of your ship again (nozzles moved, doorway cleared, hatch raised to 3 blocks). (#179, #211, #212, #214, #215)
- Deep water reads see-through — vertical depth, softer reflections and glint. (#213, #216)
- Helmet lamp switches off when you leave a planet. (#180, #182)
- Opaque world-options dialog with non-overlapping footer buttons. (#181, #182, #209, #210)
- All 27 Unity compiler/build warnings resolved — the client builds warning-clean.
- Game-input hardening on every server: packet-size caps, per-connection rate limiting, validated face data, voice frame-rate cap, control characters stripped from chat/labels. (#233)
- CI: two-tier test gate — fast PR checks, full suite on main + before release. (#208)

## [0.6.2] — 2026-06-29

Sharpens core gameplay, adds oxygen-tank tiers, seals a station/space exploit, and lays the groundwork for playing in the browser.

### 🎮 Gameplay
- Shaped blocks now have proper icons in hotbar, crafting and inventory. (#125)
- Ladders are climbable (forward/Jump up, back/Ctrl down). (#126)
- Auto-step onto slabs & stairs without jumping. (#127)
- Tool-gated mining — stone needs a drill (the starter kit grants one); soft blocks stay bare-handed. (#128)

### 🫧 Survival
- Oxygen Tank tiers I/II/III — worn components giving +50/+100/+200 max oxygen; only your best tank counts, Tank III gated behind titanium. (#133)
- Easier to climb out of water. (#133)

### 🌐 Browser client (experimental)
- Hosted WebGL client + optional PostgreSQL backend, servable from the dedicated-server Docker image. Contributed by **[@ProdigyView](https://github.com/ProdigyView) (Devin Dixon)**. (#116, #123)
- Slimmed browser start menu to name + Play. (#122)
- ⚠️ Not yet verified end-to-end — ships as experimental.

### 🛠️ Fixes & polish
- Sealed a station-to-space gap via a bounded flood-fill enclosure check. (#134, #135)
- Dev builds isolated under a separate pack ID. (#115)
- German localization fixes — thanks to **[@Maqbool61](https://github.com/Maqbool61) (Maqbool Ahmed)**. (#112)

## [0.6.1] — 2026-06-28

A focused follow-up to v0.6.0: an experimental macOS build, automatic crash reports, and one-click client downloads from your own server.

- 🍎 **Experimental macOS build** (`StandaloneOSX`, portable zip) — unsigned/un-notarized, not yet tested on real hardware; testers wanted ([#87](https://github.com/marceld23/BlocksBeyondTheStars/issues/87)). (#84, #105)
- 🐧 Native Linux client (new in v0.6.0) gains a one-click download from the server portal. (#83)
- 🛡️ **Automatic crash reporting** (server + client, opt-in, with a PII scrubber); the server tick is hardened so one bad event can't crash the world. (#103)
- ⬇️ The dedicated-server portal now hands out Windows, Linux (AppImage) and macOS clients directly. (#107)
- 👨‍👩‍👦 README, Code of Conduct, in-game Credits and Codex now state the kid-friendly intent. (#109)
- ⚙️ Faster, cleaner release CI (version resolved once and shared; Docker build decoupled; overlapping runs serialized). (#106)

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-27

Our biggest update yet: claim your own factory, explore alien ruins — and play natively on **Linux**.

- 🎉 **First community contribution** — native Linux support by **[@corarona](https://github.com/corarona) (Cora de la Mouche)**. (#69)
- 🏭 **Factories** — rare industrial halls with animated machine bays and a production terminal that turns cheap materials into bulk output.
- 🏚️ **Ruins** — collapsed settlements you can mine, plus standalone treasure chests with richer loot.
- 🔑 **SPS access codes** — a rare item that lets you claim a factory as your own editable base, shared with allies.
- 🐧 **Native Linux client** — real `StandaloneLinux64` build as AppImage + Portable.zip; the Windows-only embedded browser (CEF) was removed so the Codex Wiki and Arcade run without it.
- 🛠️ Deeper crafting: new **Transmuter** station, the **Refinery** becomes full metallurgy, and the titanium/carbide deadlock is fixed.
- 🌍 Bigger in-game editors, longer view distance, smoother movement, downhill rivers/lava with waterfalls, brighter worlds, per-world named tree species.
- 📚 New factory/ruins docs (manual + Codex, EN/DE) and a canonical source-code URL (AGPL).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-25

A graphics-quality pass and a licensing/foundation cleanup.

- 🎨 Pro-look graphics quick-wins: in-game post + SMAA + SSAO + emissive glow. (#50)
- 🎨 Per-biome cinematic mood LUTs (#51), PBR-ish GGX specular + roughness-aware reflections on voxels (#52), and a global Brightness control. (#53)
- 💧 Soft water reflections + visible sky bodies (#55); clear water you can see into again. (#56)
- 📜 Relicensed **MIT → AGPL-3.0-or-later** + a Contributor License Agreement. (#59)
- 🧩 Native in-game Arcade + Wiki — removed UnityWebBrowser/CEF, unblocking Linux/macOS. (#58)
- ⚡ Runtime-quality pass: client perf, netcode area-of-interest & interpolation, input remapping. (#60)
- 🚀 Ship cargo hold is now actively usable — manual transfer, capacity, auto-stow. (#62)

## [0.4.2] — 2026-06-23

- 🍽️ **You no longer starve in the first few minutes** — starter food (5 berries + 2 rations), an "eat" onboarding objective, an earlier hunger warning, and clearer food descriptions. (#46)
- 🔫 **A fighting chance against early hostiles** — a weak ranged starter **scrap pistol**, fixed ranged weapons only firing at point-blank, and a 3D line-of-sight gate so enemies can't hit what they can't see. (#45)
- 🐧 **Linux/Proton: no more hard 30 fps lock** — VSync is now its own setting with a separate frame-rate cap. (#47)
- 📝 README intro reworked around the family-and-community project story. (#44)

## [0.4.1] — 2026-06-22

- 🚀 No more creatures trapped in your ship — the ship evicts wild creatures on landing (companions may still follow you aboard); same guard for planet enemies. (#43)
- 🛡️ You're truly safe once aboard — visible attacks (drone fire, robot claws, creature bites) now stop the moment you board. (#41)
- 🧭 Cleaner HUD in space — the planet compass and day/night–temperature–gravity panel hide while piloting (compass stays on during EVA). (#39)
- ⌨️ Feedback is now simply **F1** — the never-clickable bottom-right button is gone. (#42)
- 🎥 Automated in-game clip recorder (video + frame-synced audio) for marketing clips. (#40)
- 🐳 Docker Desktop local-test walkthrough in SELF_HOSTING. (#38)

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-21

- 👥 **Raised the default player cap from 4 to 12** + a 12-player smoke test. (#19, #21)
- 📻 **Tiered radio reach + live voice chat.** (#30)
- 🐳 **Optional Docker image for the dedicated server.** (#26)
- 🧰 UI fix: split the in-game menu top bar into two rows so Close no longer overlaps tabs. (#35)
- ⚙️ CI hardening: PR build/test gate (warnings-as-errors, docs-only skip), format/lint/CodeQL checks, Actions pinned to SHAs, CodeQL compiles C# in manual build mode, release notes prepend the Docker pull command. (#16–#37)

## [0.3.2] — 2026-06-21

- 🚀 Explosion stays with no landing animation after ship destruction (#10); rear hatch shows a blue energy door in flight, not an open hole. (#11)
- 🛬 Landing flies the descent to the chosen planet, not the launch body. (#12)
- 👾 Floating scan-drones fire a ranged laser. (#13)
- 📸 Per-planet surface screenshots for variety (#8) with terrain-aware capture placement. (#14)
- 📝 README gains a Project Status section, table of contents and itch.io/releases links. (#6, #15)

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-20

- 🧹 Release CI strips the Burst `_DoNotShip` folder and mirrors installers to itch.io. (#4)

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-20

- 🔀 Require a pull-request workflow (repo public, `main` protected). (#1)
- 🔒 Patched langchain/langsmith/starlette security alerts in the AI backend. (#2)
- 🧹 Cleared analyzer warnings (nullable, async, dispose). (#3)
