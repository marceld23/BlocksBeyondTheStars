# SpaceCraft — Project Status

The single source of truth for **what is built** and **what is still open**. Design notes and deep
plans live under [docs/](docs/) (committed); this file is the high-level status. Player-facing operation
(controls, mechanics, editors, commands) is documented in [docs/USER_MANUAL.md](docs/USER_MANUAL.md) —
keep it current when controls/features change. Last consolidated 2026-06-04.

**Build:** `scripts/build-client.ps1` (publishes shared libs + bundled server + Unity Windows player).
**Test:** `dotnet test` — currently **259 passing**. Locale parity (en/de) is enforced by a test.
**Conventions:** English docs/comments; in-game text bilingual DE+EN; commit to `main` with the
`Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8` trailer; paid/AI asset generation is gated (propose + approve first).

Architecture: Unity 6 (Built-in RP) client + authoritative .NET 8 server, everything built in code (no
scene authoring). One shared world; contractless MessagePack networking; deterministic seed world-gen;
SQLite persistence.

---

## ✅ Done

### Foundation & server (M0–M20)
- .NET solution; shared data-driven content model + bilingual i18n; deterministic procedural universe
  (systems → bodies) from seed; SQLite persistence; LiteNetLib + loopback + MessagePack codec.
- Authoritative game server: tick loop, mine/place/craft/blueprint validators, admin API, self-hosting
  publish scripts.
- Game modes (Survival/Creative) + authoritative `GameRules` + presets; death/respawn at Medbay
  heal-tank + salvage capsule; admin roles + logged cheats.
- Mission system (system + player missions, reward depot); per-world content packs (missions/blueprints).
- WebSocket gateway + composite transport + web portal; optional Python AI mission backend (off by default).
- Personal landing zones; ship docking (request/accept/undock handshake, guest access, undock-on-disconnect).
- Space flight + PvE combat slice: ship hull/shield, ship-weapon blueprints/modules, local space
  instances, NPC drones + asteroids, planet enemies — all rule-gated, no permanent ship loss.
- Client shell: AppShell phase machine (splash → menu → settings → loading → in-game), local settings.

### World & exploration
- Seed world-gen: terrain, caves, ores (depth-banded veins), flora, multi-biome planets, 8 planet types
  (`data/planets.json`); atmosphere/oxygen rules; per-system suns.
- **Hyperspace travel** between systems (gated by a `jump_generator` module).
- **Station + settlement template world-gen** — generated worlds pick hand-designed station/town/village
  templates from a pool (~35% chance) when present, else stay procedural.
- Space stations: boarding, interiors + NPC populations (scaled by size tier), tractor beam + cargo,
  radar scanner tiers + named stations + location readout.

### Gameplay systems
- Mining/placing/crafting/blueprints; tech progression; trade (player↔player atomic swap) **with client
  panel**; scanning (handheld + ship) **with HUD readout**; wreck repair (server + progress UI).
- Survival: health/oxygen/hunger/energy; suit lamp; flora harvest drops (e.g. berries); creatures
  (habitat-gated spawns, temperament, visible attacks).
- **No building inside the ship**; ship interior stays a fixed hollow structure on landing.

### Client / UX
- In-game HUD + Tab menu (Inventory/Map/Missions/Character/Space), modern uGUI theme, UI sounds.
- **Chat** (open/type/send + scrollback) → `ChatIntent`/`ChatMessage`; `/bump` debug snapshot command.
- **World map / planet overlay** (M): top-down fog-of-war terrain, player/ship/station markers, waypoints.
- **Day/night clock** on the planet HUD; weather (IMGUI rain + lightning, density-scaled), silenced in caves.
- Singleplayer **save selection / new world** picker.
- First-person viewmodel + held tool; networked gear/held items; **avatar reflects equipped gear**
  (helmet/chest/legs/pack/lamp); procedural player + creature animation.

### Editors & tooling (full suite)
- **Ship editor**, **Avatar/skin designer**, **Station editor**, **Town editor**, **Item & recipe editor**,
  **Material editor** — each in the Editors submenu, each exporting a JSON bundle.
- Python merge tools fold bundles into `data/`: `merge_ship.py`, `merge_structure.py`, `merge_recipe.py`,
  `merge_material.py`. Material editor paints a 64×64 tile, sets mining/look/spawn (world-type targeting),
  and its look is **data-driven** via optional `BlockDefinition` fields (Gloss/Metal/Emission/Color).

### Audio & graphics
- Fully procedural audio (synthesised cues/ambiences/loops; the game is audible with zero recorded assets);
  hyperspace + boarding hooks; spatial creature voices.
- Lit block shader (per-material gloss/metal/emission, normal-mapped atlas); **per-face skylight** so caves
  + interiors go dark except lamp/emissive light; camera feel (head-bob, FOV kick, landing shake); denser
  starfields + drifting cloud shell on the menu planet; ship + station window panes.

## 🔧 Open / pending

### Partial — backend done, client polish/UI/VFX remaining
1. **Jetpack.** Only a gear-flag stub (`GameServerPresence` checks for a `jetpack` item); no item/recipe,
   no boosted-jump/short-flight mechanics, no client VFX.
2. **Weather (remaining).** Have: IMGUI rain overlay + lightning, cave-silenced. Missing: 3D in-world
   rain/splash particles, storm **sound**, and weather view-distance/fog scaling.
3. **Animation pass (remaining).** Player + creature procedural anims are in. Missing: NPC mine/attack/
   place gestures and richer per-temperament creature/NPC idle gestures.
4. **Weapon/equipment VFX (remaining).** Have: beam/tracer, muzzle flash, impact sparks, scanner pulse.
   Missing: projectile arcs, melee swing arcs, and a visible suit-lamp cone (currently a shader spotlight).

### Landing + docking — reviewed (2026-06-04)
End-to-end trace done (launch/land, same-system travel, hyperjump, space-station boarding, player↔player
docking). Findings:
- **Fixed:** boarding a space station was a one-way trip — the client never sent `LeaveStationIntent`
  (server handler existed). Added `SendLeaveStation` + a **U = leave station** prompt while boarded.
- **Done:** **landing confirmation** (L opens an Enter/Esc prompt instead of dropping instantly) and a
  **station dock-approach animation** (`Phase.Boarding`: the ship flies in + fades before boarding).
- **Remaining polish (cosmetic):** **player↔player docking** is still an instant logical transition with
  no animation (a dock-approach there would match the station boarding feel).

### Recently shipped (was partial → now done)
- **Disassemble button** — Inventory detail pane shows a Disassemble button + recovered-parts preview,
  gated on a workshop (`CraftingTechShipUI.DetailInventory`).
- **Wreck repair hint** — the HUD wreck panel now tells the player to aim at a breach + press **R** and
  lists the blocks still needed (`WreckRepairStatus.Needs`).
- **Menu closes on launch/jump** — the gameplay menu auto-closes when a launch/landing flight sequence
  begins (planet or station → `SpaceViewActive`) or a hyperspace jump starts (`HyperjumpStarted`), so the
  launch/warp animation is visible (`GameMenu`).
- **In-game admin console** — admin cheats are now typed in chat (`/give /tp /tpp /settime /setweather
  /fly /god /instant /ai`, `/help` lists them). The client parses them → `AdminCommandIntent`; the server
  still gates on `IsAdmin` + `CheatsAllowed`. `/bump` stays a chat message.

### Multi-world + system-scale flight — planned (not started) ⭐
**Firm requirement:** in multiplayer, players can be on **different planets / different star systems**
simultaneously, plus **fly between planets in a system and land on any of them**. This makes the
multi-world core (per-player worlds + per-player ship) mandatory, with a system-scale flight layer on top.
Full phased design (P1 body positions → **P2 WorldManager indirection, the keystone** → P3 multi-world +
per-player location → P4 per-player ship → P5 system flight + land-anywhere → P6 inter-system → P7
cross-world MP polish) in **[docs/MULTIWORLD_AND_SYSTEM_FLIGHT_PLAN.md](docs/MULTIWORLD_AND_SYSTEM_FLIGHT_PLAN.md)**.
Key enabler found: persistence is already **location-scoped** (the save DB can hold many worlds; only the
in-memory single `_world` blocks it). **Decision: one ship per player, no crew.**

**Progress:**
- ✅ **P1** — seeded system-space coordinates on every body (`CelestialBody`/`NetBody`/`UniverseGenerator`),
  deterministic, existing universes unchanged (`0e4162c`).
- ✅ **P2** — `WorldManager`/`LoadedWorld` seam; the active world is routed through it, behaviour-preserving
  (`f45bd41`).
- ✅ **P3a** — relocated the per-world runtime state (fauna/enemies/npcs/flora/fluids/containers/
  structures/landing zones) into `LoadedWorld` via forwarding properties to `_worlds.Active` (`e4e251a`).
- ✅ **P3b** — relocated the remaining per-world stragglers (settlement/wreck stamp scalars, creature/
  enemy/npc/fluid sim timers) into `LoadedWorld`. Weather + time-of-day stay global for now (all resident
  worlds share the sky — a known temporary limitation, refined in P7). Behaviour-preserving (`be5d48e`).
  **Every per-world gameplay system now has isolated state** — the foundation is complete.
- ✅ **P3c-1** — multi-world cache scaffolding: `WorldManager.GetOrCreate/Loaded/IsLoaded/Unload` + settable
  Active cursor; per-session `CurrentLocationId` (set on join + travel). Behaviour-preserving (`c0474ae`).
- ✅ **P3c-2a/b** — relocated weather/environment state per-world; per-world init reads the Active world,
  not global `_meta` (`bf8be4c`, `b450491`).
- ✅ **P3c-2c** — restructured the central `Tick` to iterate occupied worlds with the Active cursor; added
  `JoinedInActiveWorld`/`BroadcastToWorld`/`OccupiedLocations`/`SetActiveWorld`; scoped chunk streaming +
  presence + entity + block-change broadcasts per world; `OnPayload` sets Active to the sender's world
  (`e283a88`).
- ✅ **P3c-2d** — **per-player travel** (`HandleTravel` moves only the requester via cached `LoadWorld`,
  per-player `WorldReset`, unload-on-empty); join/disconnect world-scoped; test
  `TwoPlayers_OnDifferentPlanets_HaveIsolatedWorlds` (`3849ccb`).

**✅ P3 DONE — two players can now be on different planets / systems at once with isolated terrain, edits,
fauna and weather (261 tests).**

**✅ P7 DONE — cross-world MP polish (263 tests).** Four parts:
- **Per-player ship-stamp** (`a*`) — two players on one planet get **separate ships at distinct start
  points** (ship structure is per-player in each world; `StampShip` anchors at the served player's own
  landing zone; protection/interior cover everyone's ships). Test
  `TwoPlayers_GetSeparateShips_AtDistinctStartPoints`.
- **Position-based day/night** (`d1debb0`) — world X is a longitude: `GameBootstrap.LocalTimeOfDay` shifts
  the global day fraction by `playerX / 6000`, so one player can be on the **day side** while another is on
  the **night side** of the same planet (sky/clouds/HUD clock use local time).
- **Per-biome weather + larger biomes** (`a6a88dd`) — weather is per **biome** (a stormy biome rains while a
  clear one stays sunny), shifted by a persistent per-biome offset; the env broadcast is per-player. Biome
  noise scale 140 → 360 so each biome is a large region.
- **Star map shows the party** (`afd4ad9`) — `StarMapData.Players` lists who is on each body ("◈ Alice, Bob").

**🎉 The whole multi-world + system-flight plan (P1–P7) is complete.**

**✅ P6 DONE — inter-system travel via hyperspace jump.** Jumping between systems is the existing
`TravelIntent` + `jump_generator` from the star map (Tab → Map), reachable mid-flight. Fixed the rough
edge: jumping *from* flight no longer plays the old planet's landing descent under the warp — `SpaceView`
tears down on `HyperjumpStarted` and the full-screen warp covers the transition; the ship holds position
while the map is open. So you **fly within a system** and **jump between systems** (`ec59a31`).

**✅ P5 DONE (262 tests) — system-scale flight + land anywhere in the system.** In space you now fly
between the system's planets/moons (rendered at their P1 system coordinates, relative to the body you
launched from; the flight clamp spans the system). The nearest body in approach range is the land target —
the HUD prompts "Press L to land on <name>" and the confirm names it; `LeaveSpaceIntent.DestinationBodyId`
makes the server land you there (per-player travel; same-system = free). With nothing in range, L returns
you to where you launched. **Inter-system travel stays the hyperspace jump** (star map + `jump_generator`),
per the requirement. (`8fdfcdc` server, `c582afb` client.)

**✅ P4 DONE (merged to `main`, 261 tests) — one ship per player, no crew.** Each player owns their own
**fleet (multiple ships) with exactly one active ship**, created/loaded on join, stamped into their world,
persisted per player. Implemented with a single-threaded **ship cursor** (`_current`): `_ship`/`_ships`/
`_activeShipId` resolve to the served player; `OnPayload` + the public entry methods (`HandleTravel` top,
`CraftShip`, `Craft`, `RequestDock`) `Serve(session)` first; combat-stat caches recompute on cursor set.
Persistence is per player (`ship_<playerId>`). Built on branch `p4-per-player-ship-wip` then merged.
**Remaining edge (→ P7):** two players on the *same* planet share that world's ship-stamp state (anchor/
heal-tank); fine for different-planet play (the requirement), needs per-player ship-stamp for shared
worlds.

**Original P4 plan:** the fleet (`_ships`/`_activeShipId` in `GameServerShips`) is
currently global; make it per-player via a **session cursor** (`_current`) so `_ship`/`_ships`/
`_activeShipId` resolve to the served player's ship (mirrors the world Active cursor; single-threaded).
Sub-steps: **P4a** add per-player fleet to `PlayerSession` + the `_current` cursor + route `_ship`/`_ships`/
`_activeShipId` through it (recompute the combat-stat caches `_shipHullMax/Shield/Regen/Radar` on cursor
set); **P4b** move the ship lifecycle from Start (one shared ship) to per-join (each player loads/creates
their own ship; persistence keyed by player id); **P4c** set `_current` in `OnPayload` + before per-player
StampShip in join/travel + per-player in the space-combat tick; **P4d** untangle the test/public accessors
(`server.Ship`/`OwnedShips` → first joined player) + a two-player fleet-isolation test. Ship-stamp state
stays per-world (fine while each occupied world has one player; shared-world multi-ship is P7).

### Not started / larger future work
- **Advanced graphics roadmap** — Built-in RP vs URP decision, god rays, reflection probes, LUT grade.
  Full research in [docs/ADVANCED_GRAPHICS_PLAN.md](docs/ADVANCED_GRAPHICS_PLAN.md).
- **Texture audit** — review/expand item & icon art and creature/NPC texture variety.
- **uGUI theme polish** — remaining icon/symbol pass on the sci-fi theme.
- **Deferred by design** (see [docs/SPACE_COMBAT_CONCEPT.md](docs/SPACE_COMBAT_CONCEPT.md)): PvP ship
  combat, large cruisers/bosses. (Per-player ships shipped in P4.)
